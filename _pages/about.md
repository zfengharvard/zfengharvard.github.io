My name is Zhe Feng. I am a Research Scientist in the [Algorithms and Optimization group](https://research.google/teams/algorithms-optimization/) at Google Research, Mountain View. I got my PhD in Computer Science at Harvard University, where I was fortunately advised by [David C. Parkes](https://parkes.seas.harvard.edu/) and wrote a thesis titled [Machine Learning-Aided Economic Design](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/37368363/thesis.pdf?sequence=1). My research broadly lies in the intersection between economics and computer science, and mainly focus on understanding how to design better mechanisms through machine learning approaches. My PhD research was generously supported by [Google PhD Fellowship](https://research.google/outreach/phd-fellowship/recipients/?category=2019).

Before joining Harvard University, I got my B.S. in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics in [Zhiyuan College](https://zhiyuan.sjtu.edu.cn/html/zhiyuan/) at Shanghai Jiaotong University in July 2016, where I was fortunately supervised by [Xiaotie Deng](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/dengxiaotie/).
